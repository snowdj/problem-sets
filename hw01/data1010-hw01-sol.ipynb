Since there are 7 ways to choose the vector to remove from the latter set and 3 ways to choose which vector to remove from the first set, there are $7 \\times 3 = 21$ ways to remove two vectors from the original set to end up with a linearly independent list.  \n",

It seems not an unnatural thought to proceed with a linearly dependent vector set of three and another set of seven; an easy approach is to start with 8 linearly independent vectors, pick 2 independent vectors, and add a third linearly dependent on these two; then pick the remaining 6 independent vectors and add a vector in the span of these two.)"

    "In the game of Set, every card has four features:\n",

    "**Color**. purple, red, or green  \n",

    "\n",
    "![set](set.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "There is exactly one card for every possible combination of attributes (for example there's exactly one card with 2 red solid squiggles), so there are 81 cards in total. \n",
    "\n",
    "Three cards are said to form a set if for each feature, the three cards are either all the same or all different. For example, the cards shown above form a set because their shapes are all different, their shading is all different, the numbers are all different, and the colors are all different. \n",
    "\n",
    "The cards are shuffled, and 12 cards are dealt face up for all players to see. If any three of the cards forms a set, then the first player to identify a set gets to pick up those cards, and the cards are replaced from the deck. If no sets are present, then three additional cards are dealt. If a set is identified at 15 cards, then the three removed cards are not replaced, and the count goes back down to 12. If no sets are present even at 15 cards, then three more cards are dealt to get up to 18, and so on. The game ends when the deck is empty and there are no more sets. \n",
    "\n",
    "Write a program to simulate this game, play it 10,000 times, and find the proportion of games in which 18 cards appear at some point.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hints:**\n",
    "\n",
    "(1) You can represent cards either as 4-tuples of `Int`s (like (1, 2, 1, 1)) or as a new type.  \n",
    "(2) It's going to be important to break your program up into small, dedicated functions. For example, you can write a function for returning the 81 total cards, a function for shuffling the deck, a function which takes three cards and returns true or false depending on whether they form a set, a function for dealing cards, a function for finding all the sets on the board, a function which takes a single turn by randomly selecting one of the available sets or adding three cards to the board if there are no sets, and finally a function which puts those functions together to play the game.  \n",
    "(3) Some Julia tips: \n",
    "  - `randperm` generates random permutations, and you can index an array with the resulting list to shuffle it. \n",
    "  - `vcat` concatenates two arrays.\n",
    "  - You probably want to use a four-dimensional array comprehension to generate the list of all cards, and you can index it with a colon to flatten it.\n",
    "  - To remove elements at positions `i`, `j`, and `k` from an array `A`, you can do `A[setdiff(1:end, (i,j,k))]`\n",
    "  - You can start with an empty array and grow it one element at a time inside a loop using this pattern:\n",
    "    ```julia \n",
    "    A = []\n",
    "    for x in 1:10\n",
    "        push!(A, x)\n",
    "    end\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "  - You can use nested `for` loops to check all the triples to look for a set. There are more efficient algorithms, but that's OK."
