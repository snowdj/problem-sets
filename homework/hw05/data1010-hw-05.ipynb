You can take as given a random number generator which samples from $\\mathrm{Uniform}(0, 1)$. Explain your answer mathematically, and confirm that it works empirically by implementing your solution in code."

    "*Note: I highly recommend working this one out following the hints rather than trying to look up anything online. Every source I could find does this problem from a statistical point of view, working with $n$ observations, rather than a probabilistic point of view, working directly from the joint distribution. This method is more straightforward and offers more insight, since it shows how the connection does not actually depend on the statistical context.*\n",

    "(a) Consider two real-valued, non-constant random variables $X$ and $Y$. Find the line in the plane which minimizes the expected squared vertical distance from a point selected from the joint distribution of $X$ and $Y$ to the line. Relate the slope of this line to the correlation $\\rho$ and the standard deviations $\\sigma_X$ and $\\sigma_Y$. \n",

    "*Hint 1: Represent the line as $y = mx + b$ and write an expression for the vertical distance from the point $(X,Y)$ to the line. Take the expectation of that expression (which makes sense because $X$ and $Y$ are random variables).* \n",

    "*Hint 2: Use your multivariable calculus knowledge to find the values of $m$ and $b$ which minimize this expression. Note that expectations involving $X$ and $Y$ are constant with respect to the optimization over $m$ and $b$. It works out that the resulting system of equations is solvable by hand and only has one solution.*\n",

Describe what you would need to do with a $2 \\times 2$ matrix $\\Sigma$ if you wanted to find the directions of the major and minor axes of the ellipses which are the level sets of the multivariate Gaussian with covariance matrix $\\Sigma$. \n",

Note that each of these parts were done in class.*"

    "(a) Suppose that at each second there's a 1/100 chance of a call arriving that second (suppose for simplicity that calls don't arrive in the same second). How many calls arrive in an hour? Express the answer exactly as a named distribution, and also state another named distribution which approximately describes this random in a way that's more practically useful.\n",

    "\n",
    "(d) Let's change the model. Suppose that there are 36 people who are going to call in that hour, and each one chooses independently from the others, and uniformly at random from the available 3600 seconds, at which second they're going to call. Repeat part (b); do you get noticably different results? Consider musing on why it might make sense that this would be the case."
